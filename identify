%input media file should only be a 1 variable input, but change if needed
SE = strel(im) %not sure if needed prior to the imdilate function
dilated_im = imdilate(im, SE); %strel vs offsetstrel
eroded_im = imerode(dilated_im, SE); %reverses dilation of im, helps to create contrast
%need to write for loop for bwareaopen, as only pixels below a certain
%value can be deleted.
