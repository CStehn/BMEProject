function identified_im = identify(im) %will need to change 'im' and 'filtim' based on varname preferences
% This function will take a filtered image and output an image with easily trackable, discrete objects. The input media file should only be a 1 variable input, but change if needed

for i = 1:numel(im) % Will cycle through frames
    SE(:,:,i) = strel(im(:,:,i)); % not sure if needed prior to the imdilate function
    dilated_im(:,:,i) = imdilate(im(:,:,i), SE(:,:,i)); % strel vs offsetstrel
    eroded_im(:,:,i) = imerode(dilated_im(:,:,i), SE(:,:,i)); % reverses dilation of im, helps to create contrast
